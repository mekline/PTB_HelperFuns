# PTB_HelperFuns

A series of simple functions that wrap up some common experimental blocks, like showing text, show two videos at a time, etc., so that the top level functions read cleanly and don't break. For an example of how it works, it's more or less identical to the functions in MannerPathPriming/MPP_Stim_and_Data/HelperFunctions, at least to start. MPP() uses those functions to create a complete PTB experiment.

This version will be under pretty active development as I update it to play nicely with eyetracker code. (In theory this will improve functionality.)
