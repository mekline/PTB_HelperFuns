# PTB_HelperFuns

A series of simple functions that wrap up some common experimental blocks, like showing text, show two videos at a time, etc., so that the top level functions read cleanly and don't break. This will be under pretty active development as I update it to play nicely with eyetracker code. (In theory this will improve functionality.)
